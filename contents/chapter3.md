# Chapter 3: Customization and Publishing

Learn how to customize your book and publish it to the world.

## Book Configuration

The `config.json` file allows you to customize your book's metadata:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Book Title",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "A brief description of your book",
  "theme": "auto",
  "cover": "path/to/cover.jpg"
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **title**: The main title of your book
- **author**: Your name or pen name
- **description**: A short summary that appears in the sidebar
- **theme**: Default theme (`light`, `dark`, or `auto`)
- **cover**: Optional cover image (not yet implemented)

## Chapter Organization

Use the `index.json` file to control the order of your chapters:

```json
{
  "files": ["introduction.md", "chapter1.md", "chapter2.md", "conclusion.md"]
}
```

### Filename Conventions

If you don't create an `index.json` file, the system will automatically look for files with these patterns:

- `chapter1.md`, `chapter2.md`, etc.
- `ch1.md`, `ch2.md`, etc.
- `01.md`, `02.md`, etc.
- `introduction.md`, `preface.md`
- `epilogue.md`, `conclusion.md`

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. **Replace the content** in the `contents` folder with your own

### Automatic Deployment

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:

1. Build your book automatically
2. Deploy it to GitHub Pages
3. Make it available at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

### Custom Domain (Optional)

You can use a custom domain by:

1. Adding a `CNAME` file to the repository root
2. Configuring DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Updating the repository settings
