### Code Blocks

def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Welcome to your book!"

# Call the function
message = hello_world()
```

```javascript
function createBook() {
  const book = {
    title: "My Amazing Book",
    chapters: [],
  };

  return book;
}
```

### Tables

| -------- | ------------- | ------ |

### Blockquotes

> "Writing is thinking on paper." - William Zinsser

> This is a longer blockquote that demonstrates how the reader handles multi-line quotes. It maintains proper formatting and provides a nice visual break in the content.

## Images and Media

You can include images in your chapters:

```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep chapters focused** - Each chapter should cover a specific topic
2. **Use clear headings** - Help readers navigate your content
3. **Include examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Break up long text** - Use lists, quotes, and code blocks
5. **Test on mobile** - Ensure your content looks good on all devices

Remember, great content is the heart of any good book. Take your time to craft something meaningful!
